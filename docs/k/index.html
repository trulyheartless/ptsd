            Thank you to everyone who has shared their thoughts and additional information. This investigation aims to
            explore the actions of KT/Kayte, now known as Poorskid, and the reasons behind the scrutiny surrounding their
            involvement with Doxbin.

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why This Investigation Matters</h4>
            <p>
              KT/Kayte's role in the revival of Doxbin raises significant questions about the motivations behind their
              actions. The platform has a controversial history, and understanding why KT/Kayte has chosen to associate
              with it is crucial. This investigation seeks to uncover the truth behind their claims and the implications
              of their actions, without focusing on their identity or the platform's existence.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As we delve deeper into the history of Doxbin, we must consider the ethical implications of doxing and the
              potential harm it can cause to individuals whose information is exposed. The revival of such a platform
              under KT/Kayte's leadership could indicate a troubling trend in the online community, where personal
              information is weaponized for various purposes.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The History of Doxbin</h2>
            <p>
              Doxbin was originally launched in 2011 as a .onion service on the Tor network. It became known for hosting
              sensitive personal information, making it a target for law enforcement. The site was seized during Operation
              Onymous in 2014 but was revived in 2019 by Brenton.
            </p>

            <p>
              During its initial run, Doxbin became infamous for allowing users to post personal information about others
              without consent, leading to severe consequences for many individuals. The site's unchecked spread of private
              information made it a focal point for discussions about privacy, ethics, and the responsibilities of online
              platforms.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">New Information on KT/Kayte</h2>
            <p>
              Recent findings suggest that KT/Kayte, now known as Poorskid, has a complex history tied to the Doxbin
              platform. Here are some key points:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li>
                There are claims that the original Doxbin was created by an individual known as Drugz before KT took over.

              </li>
              <li>
                The KT stated that it was made in May of 2018, however, the site says different.

              </li>
              <li>
                Domain registration records indicate that doxbin.org was registered in 2016, modified in 2017, and expired
                in 2018.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Evidence of Domain Registration</h2>
            <p>
              According to Ryan from Lizard Squad, the original registration for doxbin.org was from November 21, 2016, to
              November 21, 2018. This information is crucial in understanding the timeline of Doxbin's ownership and the
              potential motivations behind KT/Kayte's actions.

          <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Implications of Doxbin's Revival</h2>
            <p>
              The revival of Doxbin under KT/Kayte's leadership raises concerns about the potential for increased doxing
              activities. With the rise of online harassment and the weaponization of personal information, it is
              essential to scrutinize the motivations behind such platforms. Are they merely providing a service, or are
              they contributing to a culture of harm?
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, the ethical considerations surrounding the revival of Doxbin cannot be overlooked. The
              platform's history is marred by instances of abuse, and its return could signal a troubling trend in the
              online community. As we continue this investigation, we aim to shed light on these issues and hold those
              responsible accountable.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              This investigation into KT/Kayte, now known as Poorskid, is ongoing. The connections to Doxbin and the
              history surrounding it are complex and require further exploration. As more information becomes available,
              updates will be provided. Our focus remains on the implications of their actions rather than on identifying
              individuals or shutting down platforms.
